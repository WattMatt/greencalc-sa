## ✅ Replace System Type Dropdown with Multi-Select Toggle Buttons (DONE)

Replaced the single "System Type" dropdown with three independent toggle buttons: **Solar PV**, **Battery**, and **Generator**. Each can be toggled on/off independently. Serialised as comma-separated string in `system_type` column. Backward-compatible with legacy values ("Solar", "Solar + Battery", "Hybrid").
